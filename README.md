# pytorch-notes-and-projects
This repository contains my notes and hands-on implementations in PyTorch, covering the fundamentals to advanced deep learning projects. It starts from the basics of tensors and autograd, builds up through different training pipelines, and expands into complete projects using ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs.
